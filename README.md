This is the source code for my personal page. Welcome!!
all the work has been hand crafted to showcase: 
      the responsiveness of different screen dimensions
      creativity of some popular layering techniques

this will also contain the source code for the project currently linked, "weather"


Weather---
  the current verision is V1 enter in the city you wish to view the weather report for.
  The application will utilize an API to pull temp, wind speed, wind direction to name a few.
  The background will change to reflect the current weather conditions. 
  All measurements are made in the Imperial system of measurement. 

  updates to the weather app will also be reflected in the commit notes and be "rolled in" with the main page commits.
  If no notes regarding the weather app are present then no changes have been made.
